# Early Sepsis Predictor
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure,
or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year;
over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis
and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO).
Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year,
and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018).
Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue
responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are
critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in
mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions
for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the
limits of early detection remain unanswered.
The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 provides an opportunity to address these questions.
